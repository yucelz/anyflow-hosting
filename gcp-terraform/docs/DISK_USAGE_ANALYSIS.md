# GCP Disk Usage Analysis for Development Environment

## Executive Summary

**Total Disk Usage: 42 GB (within 250GB limit ✅)**

The current development environment configuration is well within the 250GB GCP disk quota limit, using only 42GB total across all resources.

**Issues Resolved**: 
1. Fixed deployment script that was incorrectly showing 300Gi for PostgreSQL storage in summary output
2. Resolved GCP quota error by reducing PostgreSQL storage from 20Gi to 10Gi and using standard storage class
3. Added explicit n8n storage configuration to prevent default value conflicts

## Detailed Disk Allocation Breakdown

### 1. GKE Cluster Node Disks
- **Configuration**: `disk_size_gb = 30` (from dev/terraform.tfvars)
- **Node Count**: 1 node (can scale to max 3 nodes)
- **Disk Type**: `pd-standard`
- **Current Usage**: 30GB (1 node × 30GB)
- **Maximum Potential**: 90GB (3 nodes × 30GB) if scaled to maximum

### 2. PostgreSQL Persistent Storage
- **Configuration**: `postgres_storage_size = "10Gi"` (from dev/terraform.tfvars)
- **Storage Class**: `standard` (changed from standard-rwo to avoid SSD quota issues)
- **Usage**: 10GB
- **Note**: Reduced from 20Gi to resolve GCP SSD quota conflicts

### 3. N8N Application Storage
- **Configuration**: `n8n_storage_size = "2Gi"` (default from variables.tf)
- **Storage Class**: `standard-rwo`
- **Usage**: 2GB
- **Note**: Not explicitly set in dev/terraform.tfvars, uses default value

## Current vs Maximum Scenarios

### Current Development Deployment
| Resource | Size | Count | Total |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| GKE Node Disks | 30GB | 1 | 30GB |
| PostgreSQL Storage | 10GB | 1 | 10GB |
| N8N Storage | 2GB | 1 | 2GB |
| **TOTAL** | | | **42GB** |

### Maximum Scale Scenario (if all nodes scaled up)
| Resource | Size | Count | Total |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| GKE Node Disks | 30GB | 3 | 90GB |
| PostgreSQL Storage | 10GB | 1 | 10GB |
| N8N Storage | 2GB | 1 | 2GB |
| **TOTAL** | | | **102GB** |

## Compliance Status

✅ **COMPLIANT**: Current usage (52GB) is well within the 250GB limit
✅ **SAFE SCALING**: Even at maximum node count (102GB), still within limits
✅ **BUFFER AVAILABLE**: 148GB remaining capacity for future growth

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- No immediate changes required - configuration is compliant
- Current disk allocations are appropriate for development environment

### 2. Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor actual disk usage vs allocated storage
- Consider implementing disk usage alerts at 80% of quota (200GB)

### 3. Future Considerations
- PostgreSQL storage can be increased up to ~140GB while staying within limits
- Consider using `pd-ssd` for better performance if budget allows
- For production, evaluate if larger node disks are needed

### 4. Cost Optimization
- Current use of `pd-standard` disks is cost-effective for development
- `preemptible_nodes = true` provides additional cost savings

## Configuration Files Reviewed

1. `gcp-terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` - Development environment settings
2. `gcp-terraform/modules/gke/main.tf` - GKE cluster configuration
3. `gcp-terraform/modules/n8n/main.tf` - N8N and PostgreSQL storage configuration
4. `gcp-terraform/modules/n8n/variables.tf` - Default storage values

## Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK**: Current configuration poses no risk of exceeding GCP disk quotas.

The development environment is conservatively configured with appropriate disk sizes for a development workload while maintaining significant headroom for scaling and future requirements.
